# AI-Powered-Customer-Support-Chatbot-
This project proposes a backend system that offloads repetitive interactions to a chatbot while ensuring more involved cases are handed over to human agents seamlessly.
The system is designed to:
•	Handle conversations with minimal delay.
•	Integrate a flexible AI backend to generate relevant responses.
•	Maintain individual user conversations over time using session persistence.
•	Detect when automated replies are inadequate and mark them for manual escalation.
•	Provide straightforward connectivity for front-end integration via WebSocket.
